-- 3. Are supplier and manufacturing lead times aligned with demand and stock levels?Current Scenario 

-- We need to analyze the relationship between:

-- 1.Lead Time (Supplier): Lead time
-- 2.Manufacturing Lead Time: Manufacturing lead time
-- 3.Demand indicators: Number of products sold, Revenue generated
-- 4.Stock levels: Stock levels

-- Calculate average daily sales to understand consumption rate:
	-- Average Daily Sales = Number of products sold / 30 (assume 30 days)

-- Calculate how many days of stock are left:
	-- Stock Coverage (days) = Stock levels / Average Daily Sales

-- Compare stock coverage with lead times:
	-- If Stock Coverage < (Lead time + Manufacturing lead time) â†’ Stock will run out before replenishment â†’ Not aligned
